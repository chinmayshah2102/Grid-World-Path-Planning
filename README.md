# Grid World Path Planning
This project contains a small python library for path planning problems in Grid World environment.
There are multiple planning algorithms implemented here such as random planner, random planner with short memory, A-star planner, Dijkstra's planner.

The algorithms take as an input a 2D arrays of 1's and 0's, where 1 deifnes an obstacle in the environment. It also takes as input the start and goal position of the point robot. And finally it takes as an input the number of allowed actions, i.e. 4 for orthogonal movements and 8 for king moves.
